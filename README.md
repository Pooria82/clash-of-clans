# Clash of Clans - Software Engineering Diagrams

This repository contains several key software engineering diagrams related to the popular mobile game **Clash of Clans**. These diagrams are part of a Software Engineering course project, aimed at modeling the system architecture and behavior of the game using **draw.io**.

## Diagrams Overview

### 1. Use Case Diagram
This diagram represents the interaction between the **players** and the **game system**. It captures various player actions such as:
- Building and upgrading structures
- Training troops
- Attacking enemy bases
- Joining clans and participating in clan wars

### 2. Activity Diagram
The activity diagram models the sequential flow of events in processes such as:
- Collecting resources (gold, elixir, and dark elixir)
- Deploying troops during a battle
- Upgrading defenses and buildings

### 3. Class Diagram
The class diagram defines the structure of the gameâ€™s object-oriented design. Key classes include:
- **Player**
- **Village**
- **Troop**
- **Building**
- **Resource**

It outlines relationships between classes, including inheritance, associations, and compositions.

### 4. Sequence Diagram
The sequence diagram shows the interaction between game objects for specific scenarios, such as:
- A player initiating an attack
- A troop moving towards a target and attacking it
- Calculating damage and loot after a battle

### 5. Project Description
An overall description of the project, explaining the key features of Clash of Clans, the objectives of the project, and how the diagrams help in modeling the game from a software engineering standpoint.

## How to View the Diagrams
All diagrams were created using **draw.io**. To view or edit the diagrams:
1. Open the `.drawio` files with the [draw.io editor](https://app.diagrams.net/).
2. Alternatively, export the diagrams as `.png` or `.svg` for quick viewing.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pooria82/clash-of-clans.git
   ```
2. Open the `.drawio` files in **draw.io** or view the exported images.

## Project Details
- **Course**: Software Engineering
- **Tools**: draw.io
